Steganography Project: Hiding Messages in Images

Steganography is the practice of concealing a secret message within an ordinary file or medium, such as an image, without drawing attention. This project focuses on implementing
image-based steganography, where a hidden message is embedded into an image file in such a way that it remains visually unchanged.

How It Works
The message is encoded by modifying the least significant bits (LSB) of the image pixels, ensuring minimal distortion.
The modified image looks identical to the original to the human eye.
A decoding algorithm retrieves the hidden message from the altered pixels.
Applications
Secure communication
Watermarking digital content
Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information
This project will involve writing a program (in Python, Java, or any preferred language) to encode and decode messages within images, ensuring secure and covert transmission
of information. ðŸš€
